Additional assumptions:
- if stay time  01h00m00s then we charge for 1 hour, if 01h00m01s then we charge for 2 hours
- stay can be started and ended on different days
- when calculating charge for a given day, only stays *ended* that day are taken into account
- type of the customer is determined at the start of the stay
